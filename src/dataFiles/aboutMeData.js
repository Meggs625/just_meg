        description: "In 2021, I took a leap with a new career in software after discovering a love for Excel. I quickly enrolled in a local accredited coding school, Turing Software Development and Design. After 7 months of grueling study and 70 - 80 hour weeks, I graduated with my Frontend Engineering certification. | Thus far, I've continued a focus on the frontend. I've leaned into my passion for both user experience and accessibility. An easy user flow can make or break a site. That being said, there are so many other avenues that I am excited to explore. I'm just starting a course to learn Ruby on Rails and backend structure. There is never a shortage of things to learn.",

Most recently, I've begun to learn how to play the cello, which I completely underestimated the difficulty before I started. The cello resonates a rich and soulful sound, which I hope one day to find. In the meantime, my family continues to accept the screeching that emanates from my office. | I've also recently re-discovered the art of crochet and have joined a local crochet circle. This amazing group has helped my skills improve and I've begun more challenging projects. Currently working furiously to wrap up Christmas presents before that deadline.",

She was trepidatious at first, but over time and with training, eased into the house beautifully. It was such a rewarding experience to watch her trust in us grow until she became my full time shadow. | A year after she was settled in, we ended up taking in two more dogs from the same shelter in quick succession. Although our third dog was supposed to only be fostered, in three short days, we couldn't let that little face go!

Getting lost in a story, in a bit of history, in a different world, is unlike anything else. | Although my 'Want to Read' list is growing faster than I can read, I will continue my efforts to make it through as many as possible! It brings me great joy to see my written word appreciation passed to my youngest kiddo as well. We have regular Reading Parties, snuggled up together with our current reads.

Although not a great skier, and never a snowboarder, I enjoy getting out for a hike, or grabbing the paddle board and heading to a lake. | Nature and the outdoors are restorative to my soul. Although it is hard to admit, it wasn't until 2019 that I conquered my first Colorado 14er. On a crisp August morning, my cousin and I summited Grey's Peak and took in the indescribable view.
